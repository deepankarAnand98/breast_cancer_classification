## Overview

I created a model which classified the breast cancer data as either malignant or benign based on the given data. This is a supervised machine learning problem hence I used Xgboost, SVM and Random Forest for modelling. Xgboost's perforance had an accuracy of 99.13%.

### Dataset

The original dataset is imbalanced. I applied SMOTE to balance the dataset
